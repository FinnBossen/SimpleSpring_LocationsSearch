# SimpleSpring_LocationsSearch
 A simple Spring Project with a login form that passes everything that the user inputs 
 after the login a Form appears where the user can search some locations that are stored in the project on runtime.
 Every User that logs in will be stored in a loggerfile with log4j.
 
 I created this project to learn some spring basics and fundamentals.
